Basic Introduction
=============================================

This repo will be dedicated to creating a packet sniffer using python.

- A Sniffer (also known as a network analyzer, protocol analyzer or packet analyzer, or for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer) is a computer program or a piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network or part of a network. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.

This workshop would be dedicated to understanding socket programming in python to create a packet sniffer which can sniff all the incoming and outgoing packets from a particular interface (Ethernet or Wireless) without using any external libraries like libpcap. It will also sniff all Ethernet frames , which means all kinds of IP packets(TCP , UDP , ICMP) and even other kinds of packets(like ARP).
